# Loan Payment Calculator

This is a simple loan payment calculator. The `Loan` class is used to represent a loan with a fixed APR. It provides methods to calculate how many payments are needed to pay off the loan and when the loan will be paid off.

The motivation was that I wanted to know how long it would take me to pay off my student loans.

## Usage

Given the example loan in `loan.example.json`, and the example payment schedule and payment amount in `main.py`, you can run the script to see the output below.

```terminal
loan-payment-calculator $ python3 main.py
Your loan will be paid off by 2029-04-22, which is about 3 years and 5 months from now.
There are 91 payments remaining.
```
